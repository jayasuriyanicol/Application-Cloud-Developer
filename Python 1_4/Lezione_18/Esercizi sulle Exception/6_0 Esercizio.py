'''
6.Personalized math library: Create a Python library that provides functions for handling fractions, with built-in error handling. The library must include functions for the following operations:

    Create a fraction from the numerator and denominator.
    Collect the numerator and denominator of a fraction.
    Simplify a fraction.
    Add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions.
    Check whether one fraction is equivalent to another. 

    All library functions must use the try-except block to handle potential errors, such as null denominators, unsupported operations, or division by zero. The library must raise custom exceptions to indicate specific errors to the user.
